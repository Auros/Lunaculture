Ludum Dare 52 Game Jam with @legoandmars and @Caeden117

## What is Ludum Dare
Ludum Dare is a 72 hour online game jam where developers get together and build a game around a theme over a weekend.

## This Event

This event, Ludum Dare 52, I teamed up with @legoandmars and @Caeden117 to build this game: **Lunaculture**.

We had to follow the theme of harvest, so we made a plant growing game that takes place on a fictional moon named Iridium.

It was built using Unity 2021.3.16f1
